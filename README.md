<h2> üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;About Me </h2>

I'm a software engineer focused on full stack development, passionate about building scalable, modern, and well-architected solutions. I‚Äôve worked on high-impact projects in Brazil, the UK, and the US, using technologies like TypeScript, React & React Native, Next.js, Node.js, Docker, AWS, Kafka, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, microservices, and much more.

I wrote my first lines of code at age 11, when I wanted to create a private server for a game I loved at the time. After a lot of research, I finally got it online ‚Äî and the feeling was magical. I realized I could customize anything just by writing code. That moment changed everything for me: I knew I wanted to become a developer.

Since then, I‚Äôve remained deeply passionate about programming and constantly strive to learn more and become a better professional every day.

<h2> üéì &nbsp;Lifelong Learner & Educator </h2

One of the things I'm most passionate about is continuous learning and sharing knowledge with others. Since the beginning of my journey, I've been fascinated not only by solving complex problems with code but also by helping others understand and grow in their own paths.

That's why I founded the <strong>[Full Stack Club](https://www.fullstackclub.com.br/)</strong>, a community where I mentor and support over <strong>3,000 aspiring developers</strong>. There, I teach practical skills in technologies like TypeScript, React, Node.js, and more ‚Äî all with a hands-on, real-world approach focused on building solid careers in software engineering.

I also run a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@dicasparadevs) where I‚Äôve been creating content for over 5 years. My videos have accumulated more than <strong>2.5 million views</strong>, and my React and Node.js courses are among the most watched in Brazil. Through my content, I aim to make high-quality programming education accessible and practical for everyone.

Teaching helps me grow as much as coding does, and I'm always striving to be a better developer, mentor, and human being.
